			<h3>Who We Are</h3>
			<p>The MAP is an organization, independent from the union, staffed by licensed social workers and counselors who can help you identify and resolve problems. The Local 28 Field Monitor works closely with the MAP to investigate complaints, intervene on behalf of minority apprentices and mechanics when necessary and help achieve fair resolution of on-the-job problems.</p>
			<h3>Appointment Information</h3>
			<p>Everything discussed in counseling sessions is completely confidential except for situations that require preventing serious harm (to self or others) or stopping the abuse of a child, elderly person or someone of diminished capacity.</p>
			<p>MAP services are provided at no direct cost to you. If you and the MAP counselor decide additional resources are necessary, you will then be responsible for any charges associated with these outside resources. Sometimes your union health plan will cover these costs.</p>
