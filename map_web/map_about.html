			<h3>What is a Members Assistance Program?</h3>
			<p>Working people sometimes have problems that can upset their workday, their home life, and even their health. The Union has decided to lend a hand to help members deal with their problems by establishing this MAP as a free benefit for all members.</p>
			<p>The MAP is an organization independent from the union. The MAP is staffed by licensed social workers and counselors who can help you and your family to identify and resolve problems.</p>
			<h3>What Types of Problems Can MAP Help Solve?</h3>
			<p>The MAP will help you address such problems as family and marital conflicts, financial and legal difficulties, emotional issues and drug and alcohol problems, among others. Just as you use your health insurance for a physical problem, you can use the MAP to help you resolve your personal problems.</p>
			<h3>Are There Any Costs to Me for the MAP Services?</h3>
			<p>NO. The MAP services are provided at no cost to you. If you and the MAP counselor decide additional resources are necessary, you will then be responsible for any charges associated with these outside resources. Sometimes your union health plan will cover these costs. The decision to use any outside resource is always left up to you.</p>
