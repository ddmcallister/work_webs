			<h2>Keeping the following in mind helps us send you the workers you need:</h2>
		</header>
		<div id="main-tips">
			<div class="summary">
				<h3><i class="fa fa-plus" class="expand"></i> File your request on time</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="detail">
				<p>Give the Operators time to contact you with questions before referral hours start. Referral hours are 6pm – 8pm, Monday – Friday.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<h3><i class="fa fa-plus" class="expand"></i> Include as much information as you can about the job and the skills/certifications it requires</h3>
			</div> 
			<div class="detail">
				<p>Give a complete address. Tell the mechanic where to meet, or if not, who to contact the day of the job for meeting directions.</p>
				<p>If you do not see a checkbox for the specialty or certification you need, use the comments section at the bottom of the form to provide further details.</p>
				<p>Operators will contact you if anything is unclear – another reason to get your request in as early in the day as possible!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<h3><i class="fa fa-plus" class="expand"></i> Find out who we sent</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="detail">
				<p>We’re happy to let you know who to expect on the job once placements are complete. Please indicate whether you would prefer an email or a text and make sure the relevant contact information is included on the form. The names and phone numbers of the members placed will be sent to you once the job is filled.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<h3><i class="fa fa-plus" class="expand"></i> Let us know if the job is Short Term</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="detail">
				<p>Short-term jobs are 12 days or fewer. We understand that many factors contribute to job duration. Checking the box for a Short Term does not prohibit you from keeping workers longer than 12 days; similarly, not checking the Short Term job box does not restrict you from letting members go.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<h3><i class="fa fa-plus" class="expand"></i> Report No-Shows</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="detail">
				<p>Should the placed member(s) not show up on the required start date, please report this to the Referral Hall Operator at 212-732-5979.</p>
				<p>Members who are No-Shows will be barred from the referral hall for 90 days.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="summary">
				<h3><i class="fa fa-plus" class="expand"></i> File Do Not Sends</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="detail">
				<p>You can request that members who have not worked out for you in the past not be referred, whether you hired them through the Referral Hall or not.<p>
				<p>Include their names and a brief explanation of why you would prefer not to have them referred along with your request, or as a separate letter, and they will be added to your Contractor Do Not Send list.</p>
				<p>Being on your Do Not Send list automatically prevents those members from being in the call list when we fill any job for you.</p>
				<p>Members will be notified if you place them on your Do Not Send list.</p>
				<p>You may rescind a Do Not Send request at any time.</p>
