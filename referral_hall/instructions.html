			<h1><span>Referral Hall Overview for Contractors</span></h1>
		</header>

		<div id="main-instruct">

			<h2 class="instruct-head">Overview</h2>
				<div class="details">
					<p>Contractors who are signatory to the new CBA are required to use the Voluntary Referral Hall for 1 out of every 4 new hires—but the VRH is also available for any other workforce needs you may have.<p>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>If a contractor needs to hire a Local 28 journeyperson for fan maintenance work, the contractor must use the VRH.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>Any contractor who is not a signatory to Local 28's CBA (including those who are signatories to the International Agreement and out-of-town contractors) who need to hire Local 28 members must use the VRH. Such contractors should contact the appropriate Business Agent.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>Please note: jobs at the B rate, specialty work, and apprentice referrals are not placed through the Referral Hall.</p>
				</div> 

			<h2 class="instruct-head">How does it work?</h2>
				<div class="details">
					<p>Out of work L28 mechanics telephone the VRH and place themselves on the list. During this call mechanics can indicate their special skills (certified welder, roofer), if any.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>During referral hours (6pm – 8pm, Monday – Friday), the Operator calls any open jobs. The computer selects the highest ranking available journeyperson with the necessary skills and contacts that member by telephone.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="details">
					<p>If the journeyperson does not answer, or refuses the job, the next highest ranking journeyperson is contacted. This process continues until the referral is accepted.</p>
					</div>
			<h2 class="instruct-head">Making a Request</h2>
				<div class="details">
